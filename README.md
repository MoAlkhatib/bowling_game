Mission: BOSS LEVEL
Objective: Bowling simulation
Part 1
It's time to let the player actually play our bowling game and not just by pressing enter to continue! To start off, we should let them choose which part of the lane they want to roll the ball down.

We could give the player 7 options, like this:



If they roll the ball down path 1, they should knock down pin number 7. If they roll it down path 3, they would knock down pin 2. If they then roll the ball again down path 3, then pin 8 would get knocked. And if they roll it down a path where all the pins have been knocked down, they don't knock over a pin at all.

Completion goals:
Continue (or copy/paste) the code of the Bowling pins mission.
After you draw the pins, write out the 7 possible paths and let the player choose one of them.
Instead of randomly generating which pins get knocked down, knock down the first pin in that path (or none if the path is empty).
